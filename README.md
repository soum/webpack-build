# complile sass and js using webpack

Explores some webpack concepts to compile js and css

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

minimum node version v6.2.0. This works for me. No sure anything lower than this is worth using

```
npm -v 
```

### Installing

create your project directory and assuming you already have the project pulled down. Do

```
npm install
```

### Build

```
npm run build
```
